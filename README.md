## Special thanks

This library wouldn't be written so fast without the complete inspiration from
[hrw/onyx-send2boox](https://github.com/hrw/onyx-send2boox). I initially thought
about simply forking it, but I realized that I would rather prefer to have a
different approach. That's why this repository solely focuses on 2 things:

- API
- CLI

Once again, thanks hrw for your outstanding work!
