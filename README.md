## Special thanks

Big thanks to [hrw](https://github.com/hrw)
and their project [onyx-send2boox](https://github.com/hrw/onyx-send2boox).
Their work was the main inspiration behind this tool.
While pyBooxDrop is a fresh, focused take on just the API and CLI,
this project wouldnâ€™t exist without their awesome groundwork.

Thanks for the great job!
